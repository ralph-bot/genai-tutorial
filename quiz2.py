articles = "About half of parents surveyed by the Kaiser Family Foundation say they’re worried about measles. Yet as cases continue to spread, so does conflicting information about vaccine safety and effectiveness. Much of this information is false or misleading, but the volume can make sorting fact from fiction difficult. \
Bonnie Maldonado, MD, the Taube Professor in Global Health and Infectious Diseases and a professor of pediatrics, has spent 15 years researching measles and vaccine effectiveness \
    in babies and recently co-authored a publication forecasting millions of U.S. measles cases over the next 25 years if vaccination rates continue to decline.\
    We asked her to address the risks of measles, vaccine safety and effectiveness, and other common points of confusion. These are the five main takeaways. \
    Complications are more common than you might think. While measles is sometimes compared to chickenpox, it is much more likely to lead to severe health complications and even death. \
    we asked again , Measles works by invading the respiratory tract, where it infects local lymph nodes before eventually spreading to the rest of the body,” Maldonado said. For this reason, measles tends to impact a person’s respiratory tract, brain, and other parts of the central nervous system."
