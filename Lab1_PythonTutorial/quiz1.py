articles = "About half of parents surveyed by the Kaiser Family Foundation say they’re worried about measles. Yet as cases continue to spread, so does conflicting information about vaccine safety and effectiveness. Much of this information is false or misleading, but the volume can make sorting fact from fiction difficult. \
Bonnie Maldonado, MD, the Taube Professor in Global Health and Infectious Diseases and a professor of pediatrics, has spent 15 years researching measles and vaccine effectiveness in babies and recently co-authored a publication forecasting millions of U.S. measles cases over the next 25 years if vaccination rates continue to decline."
